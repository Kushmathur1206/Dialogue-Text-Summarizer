This project is an abstractive dialogue summarization system that utilizes PEGASUS, a state-of-the-art transformer model from Google, originally trained on large-scale datasets like CNN/DailyMail, and further fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset to better handle informal and conversational text formats.

Project Highlights
- Transfer Learning: Leveraged the pretrained PEGASUS model (trained on CNN/DailyMail) and fine-tuned it on the SAMSum dataset to improve summarization performance on multi-turn dialogues.
- Transformers: Utilized the Hugging Face transformers library for easy integration and deployment of large pretrained models.
